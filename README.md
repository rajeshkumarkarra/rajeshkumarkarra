Final year project: [‚ÄúQuantum optimization challenge - Get your starship out of a sticky situation!‚Äù](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bX84MqDfMqo6XauReF9x7Q07c317oGqDscHbnScdiHE/edit?usp=sharing)
This paper presents a novel application of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) in a time-critical scenario: optimizing debris collection by an autonomous drone during a starship's approach to a black hole. Large debris poses a catastrophic collision threat, necessitating efficient collection along the shortest path.Utilizing precise distance measurements between debris pieces, we formulate the mission as a TSP instance. The acknowledged NP-completeness of TSP highlights the inherent computational challenge. However, by drawing a parallel to the classic traveling salesman scenario, we demonstrate the broader applicability of this problem to various logistical and optimization tasks beyond space exploration.This research investigates the potential of IBM Quantum's QISKIT platform to solve the formulated TSP for debris collection. By exploring the capabilities of quantum computing for this real-world problem, this work aims to contribute to the development of efficient solutions for time-sensitive path optimization within a critical spacefaring context.
